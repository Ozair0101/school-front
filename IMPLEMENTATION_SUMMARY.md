# Online Monthly Exam System - Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the complete implementation of the React frontend for the online monthly exam system that integrates with the existing Laravel backend.

## Overview

We've successfully implemented a comprehensive online exam system with the following key features:

### Student Flow
1. **Exam List** - View available exams with filtering and search
2. **Exam Detail** - Review exam information and start exam with access code support
3. **Exam Canvas** - Take exams with:
   - Timer with warnings (5 min, 1 min)
   - Progress tracking
   - Question navigation
   - Autosave every 10 seconds
   - Offline support
   - Proctoring capture
   - Review modal
4. **Question Types** - Support for all required question types:
   - Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ)
   - True/False
   - Numeric
   - Short Answer
   - Essay
   - File Upload

### Teacher/Admin Flow
1. **Monitoring Dashboard** - Real-time view of in-progress attempts
2. **Grading Queue** - List of exams needing manual grading with inline grading UI
3. **Proctoring Events** - View proctoring events for each attempt

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **React v18+** with functional components and hooks
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **React Router** for client-side routing
- **React Query** for server state management
- **Axios** for HTTP client with interceptors
- **Socket.IO** for real-time events
- **LocalForage** for offline storage

```

### Key Components

#### 1. API Service Layer (`services/api.ts`)
- Axios instance with authentication and attempt token interceptors
- Methods for all backend endpoints
- Type definitions for all data models
- File upload with presigned URLs

#### 2. Custom Hooks
- `useExamAutosave`: Handles autosave with debounce, offline queueing, and retries
- `useServerTimeSync`: Synchronizes client time with server

#### 3. Question Components
- Component for each question type with review mode support
- Keyboard navigation and accessibility features
- Proper error handling and validation

#### 4. Core Pages
- `ExamsList`: Responsive exam listing with search and filters
- `ExamDetail`: Exam information and access control
- `ExamCanvas`: Main exam interface with all required functionality
- `Teacher/Monitoring`: Real-time monitoring dashboard
- `Teacher/GradingQueue`: Manual grading interface

### Security Features
- Attempt tokens for all state-modifying operations
- HTTPS enforcement
- Secure token storage (memory with localStorage fallback)
- Input validation and sanitization

### Offline Support
- Automatic answer queuing when offline
- Local storage fallback using LocalForage
- Sync when connectivity is restored
- Visual indicators for sync status
- Retry mechanism with exponential backoff

### Proctoring
- Camera snapshot capture with user consent
- Tab visibility tracking
- Event logging and reporting
- WebSocket integration for real-time events

### Accessibility
- Keyboard navigation support
- ARIA attributes
- Focus management
- Proper contrast ratios
- Screen reader support

### Testing
- Unit tests for core components and hooks
- Integration tests for main flows
- Accessibility audits

## API Integration

The frontend integrates with the Laravel backend through:

### Core Endpoints
- `POST /api/monthly-exams/{id}/start` - Start exam attempt
- `POST /api/student-attempts/{id}/answer` - Save answer
- `POST /api/student-attempts/{id}/submit` - Submit exam
- `GET /api/student-attempts/{id}/status` - Get attempt status
- `POST /api/monthly-exams/{id}/presign` - Get presigned URL for file uploads

### Real-time Events
- WebSocket channel `exam.{exam_id}.monitor`
- Events: `attempt_started`, `proctor_event`, `attempt_updated`

## Deployment

The application can be deployed using:
- Standard build process (`npm run build`)
- Static file hosting (Apache, Nginx, etc.)
- CDN for improved performance
- HTTPS for security

## Sample Data

Sample data is provided for local development and testing in `utils/sampleData.ts`.

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is provided in the `docs/` directory:
- API Integration Guide
- Deployment Guide
- Offline Sync Mechanism

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for future development:
1. Internationalization support
2. Advanced analytics and reporting
3. Mobile app version
4. AI-powered proctoring
5. Enhanced accessibility features
6. Additional question types
7. Integration with LMS platforms

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a complete, production-ready online exam system that meets all specified requirements while maintaining security, accessibility, and performance standards. The modular architecture allows for easy maintenance and future enhancements.
